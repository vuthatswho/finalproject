Vu Nguyen
Course Project Proposal

API: Spoonacular

I want to build this because I enjoy food. We need it in our lives to live
and there are various types of eaters. There are so many different types of
foods and recipes and it would be nice to filter down or search for certain
foods that you want to eat. Are you a vegan? Pescatarian? On a keto diet?
Hopefully this site/tool I will eventually build can help you out!
